# Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) — Canonical Formulation

This repository contains the **canonical, non-speculative formulation** of the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT).

UBT is built around a **biquaternion-valued field** defined over **biquaternion time**:
$$\Theta(q, T_B), \quad q \in \mathbb{H}_\mathbb{C}, \; T_B = t + i\psi + j\chi + k\xi,$$
where $t$ is real time and $\psi, \chi, \xi$ are dynamical imaginary time components.

In the **complex-time reduction** (when directional isotropy applies: $\chi = \xi = 0$), this reduces to:
$$\Theta(q, \tau), \quad \tau = t + i\psi.$$

The theory provides a unified geometric framework for:

- biquaternionic field geometry and complex-time dynamics,
- the emergence of a metric and stress–energy tensor from \(\Theta\),
- gauge structures compatible with the Standard Model,
- spinor sectors and Hermitian limits of the theory.

This repository intentionally **does not include**:
- numerical mass fits or concrete parameter predictions,
- detailed phenomenological models,
- speculative consciousness/psychon sectors or CTC/multiverse models.

Those belong either to internal research repositories or to future, clearly
labelled extension projects.

## Repository structure

- `canonical/` – core field equations, Lagrangians, covariant derivatives,
  gauge sector, and appendices (Hermitian limit, emergent SU(3),
  theta-phase structure).
- `core/` – axiom sets and foundational algebraic/geometric assumptions.
- `docs/` – verification report, glossary of symbols, and documentation of
  the consolidation process.
- `logo/` – logo assets for the UBT Institute.

## Status

The goal of this repository is to provide a **stable, citable reference** for the
mathematical and geometric backbone of UBT. It is meant as a basis for:

- rigorous peer review,
- PhD-level theoretical work,
- future extension papers (spectral methods, mass spectra, consciousness models, etc.).

Active research on mass spectra, the fine-structure constant, spectral constructions,
and consciousness-related extensions happens **outside** this canonical repository.
