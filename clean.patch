+This repository contains the **canonical, non-speculative formulation**
+of the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT).  
+It includes:
+
+• Biquaternionic field structure Θ(q, τ)  
+• Complex-time framework τ = t + iψ  
+• Canonical derivation of gauge structures compatible with the Standard Model  
+• Tensor formulation, metric emergence, SU(3) sector, and Hermitian limit  
+
+No numerical predictions, phenomenological fits,  
+or speculative consciousness-sector models are included here.
+
+### Repository Structure
+
+**canonical/** — rigorous field equations, Lagrangians, gauge sector  
+**core/** — axiom sets, algebraic definitions  
+**docs/** — verification report, classification, glossary  
+
+### Status
+This is the public canonical theory.  
+Research extensions (mass predictions, psychon sector, spectral fits,  
+CTC structures, numerical solvers, etc.) are maintained in a  
+**separate private repository**.
